  <p>We are registered as a data controller with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. Our data protection registration number is TBC.</p>

  <h2>2. Personal data we collect about you</h2>

  <h2>6. Security of your personal data</h2>
  <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Data is transmitted securely using encryption. Data may be accessed by approved third parties (e.g. hosting providers) and may be transferred outside the EEA with safeguards in place.</p>

  <h2>7. Cookies and tracking technologies</h2>
  <p>We use cookies, pixels and analytics to improve our services and understand how users interact with our site, app, and emails. You can delete cookies via your browser settings; most features will remain accessible without them. For more information, see our Cookie Policy.</p>

  <h2>9. International transfers and retention</h2>
  <p>Your personal data may be accessed and processed outside the EEA (including by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us).

We retain personal data as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy or to comply with law.</p>

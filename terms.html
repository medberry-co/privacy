  <h1>Medberry Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 01 Sep 2025</p>

  <h2>1) About these Terms</h2>
  <p>These Terms govern your use of the Medberry app and related services. “Medberry”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refers to Medberry Ltd (UK company no. 09382108).</p>

  <h2>2) Subscription & Billing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Free trial: <strong>7 days</strong> for new users.</li>
    <li>Subscription: <strong>£1.49 per month</strong>, 30-day periods, auto-renewing unless turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
    <li>Billing: charged to your Apple iTunes/App Store account at purchase and within 24 hours prior to renewal.</li>
    <li>Manage/cancel: in your Apple Account Settings. No cancellation of the current period is allowed during an active period.</li>
    <li>Access: a subscription is required to log data and generate reports; prior data and CSV export remain available without a current subscription.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Acceptable Use & Data Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must comply with your hospital/Trust rules regarding logbooks and personal data (including patient-identifiable information).</li>
    <li>Do not input “Sensitive Personal Data” unless you have explicit, informed, voluntary consent as required by applicable law and your organisation’s policies.</li>
    <li>Limit patient-identifiable information wherever possible; typical permitted fields include hospital, hospital number, or date of birth—follow local requirements.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for confirming consent where required and for compliance with your local policies and law. Medberry is not responsible for your failure to obtain consent.</li>
    <li>You should maintain secure backups of your data. If data is lost, Medberry is not liable for loss.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Accounts, Social Login & Privacy</h2>
  <p>If you choose Facebook Login, we may receive your name, email address, Facebook user ID, and profile picture (if granted) to authenticate you and manage your account. See our
     <a href="https://medberry-co.github.io/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> and
     <a href="https://medberry-co.github.io/privacy/data-deletion.html">Data Deletion Instructions</a>.</p>

  <h2>5) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The app and its contents are protected by intellectual property rights and belong to Medberry or our licensors.</li>
    <li>Except as permitted by law, you may not copy, redistribute, or commercialise the app or its materials without prior written consent. Limited personal/non-commercial copying is allowed with notices intact.</li>
    <li>You may not use the Medberry name or logo without prior written permission.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Availability</h2>
  <p>We aim for high availability but do not guarantee continuous access. Access may be suspended for maintenance, outages, or events beyond our control.</p>

  <h2>7) Third-Party Services (including Apple)</h2>
  <p>Medberry may rely on third-party services (e.g., Apple for subscriptions, Zendesk for support). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. Apple App Store terms, including the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (EULA), apply to your purchase and use of the iOS app.</p>

  <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>Except as required by law, the app and services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

  <h2>9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the extent permitted by law, Medberry will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or economic loss (including loss of data, profits, placement, or reputation). In no event will our total liability exceed £50 (or the minimum amount required by law).</p>

  <h2>10) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will post updates here and revise the “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>11) Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The courts of England and Wales have non-exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
